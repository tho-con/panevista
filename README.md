# q&a
"hey idiot! why is it 7tsp?"
1. its easier for me to work with
2. its changes are much more easily reversible and you dont have to risk getting sfc /scannowned because you did one too many mods to your system
3. it works for me

"ntmu when"
- soon(TM) but im too lazy to port it rn

"why call it panevista"
- pane is like a buzzword so like imagine "AI Rice Cooker" and how it uses ai as a buzzword
